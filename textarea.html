much-text - text area for code
==============================

#    SUMMARY

&lt;much-text&gt; is a web component for monospaced, multi-line text entry, with
features useful for building text editors for programming languages and markup.
It works as a drop-in replacement for the &lt;textarea&gt; HTML element and is
ethically programmed to be conscientious about performance and memory use.

This page provides an easy way to experiment with much-text's features, which
are configured by HTML attributes. Neither the "dark mode" theme in use here,
nor the markdown-like syntax highlighting are part of much-text itself, see the
STYLING and SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING sections below for details.
